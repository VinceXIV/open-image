# open-image

Open *the how-it-works.ipynb* file to see a demonstration of some of the things that have been done in this work

## Setup
1. install virtualenv; `pip3 install virtualenv`
2. create a virtual environment; `virtualenv env`
3. activate the virtual env `source env/bin/activate`
4. install all packages listed in the requirements.txt file; `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
5. open your jupyter notebook and work on it

Alternatively, you could install the packages in the requirements.txt without setting up virtual environment. In that case, just run 4 and 5

## Setup Requirements
1. Have JupyterNotebook configured. Could be through Anaconda, or whichever way you deem better
2. Python3. I used python 3.8.10. I can't guarantee that the project would work as well on other versions
